# Agentic feature delivery

Own the complete integrated result in one orchestrated session. Minimize total
tokens and latency without weakening correctness, evidence, or review.

1. Read repository instructions and `docs/agent-context.md` when present.
   Read `docs/harness-evolution.md` when it exists and a recurring failure is
   relevant. Inspect the working tree and preserve unrelated changes.
2. Decide whether orchestration is justified. Handle a small, obvious,
   localized edit directly without subagents.
3. Resolve meaningful ambiguity before editing. Establish outcomes,
   constraints, non-goals, edge cases, and acceptance criteria. Ask only about
   decisions that materially change behavior, architecture, risk, cost, or
   destructive scope.
4. Before implementation, require a Git repository, a clean working tree, and
   an attached HEAD unless the user explicitly opts out for this task. Show the
   current branch and short HEAD, ask the user to confirm the intended base and
   supply the working branch name, then create or switch to that branch. If an
   existing branch diverges from the confirmed base, disclose that and ask
   before switching. Recheck the resulting branch and HEAD. Without an explicit
   opt-out, stop on dirty, non-Git, detached, or unexpected state. With one,
   record the exact exception and user-confirmed starting state. Never stash,
   discard, clean, or switch implicitly.
5. Assign a risk tier: localized, module-level, cross-cutting, or
   high-consequence. For high-consequence work, obtain explicit human
   acceptance criteria before changing security, billing, privacy, destructive,
   or production-impacting behaviour.
6. Explore actual code paths and tests. Delegate focused read-only questions
   when this protects the parent context or materially reduces total tokens or
   latency.
7. Build a dependency-aware task graph. Every delegated task must state its
   goal, acceptance criteria, owned scope or files, relevant context,
   constraints, validation command, and return contract.
8. Parallelize only independent work. Parallel writers must have explicit,
   non-overlapping file ownership. Never overlap shared migration, schema, or
   integration surfaces.
9. Delegate adaptively rather than assigning one agent to every phase. Keep a
   small localized change with the parent when the handoff would cost more than
   the work. Give faster capable agents only the context required for a bounded
   task, reuse compact findings across phases, combine implementation with its
   focused tests when ownership aligns, and stop obsolete branches early.
10. Once a reviewable draft or diff exists, launch the lowest-cost capable
    read-only subagent in parallel with validation or review using
    `$refactor-code` audit mode. Scope it to the affected methods or functions
    and minimum context, never the whole file by default. Implementation,
    validation, and review must not depend on its completion, but collect its
    result before the final handoff. Report pre-existing smells without fixing
    them; route issues introduced by the feature through normal review.
11. Keep architecture and integration decisions with the parent. Inspect every
   returned change and the final diff; subagent reports are not proof.
12. Run fast deterministic checks before handoff, then the broader checks the
   risk tier requires before integration. Use tests, linters, type checks, and
   structural checks as primary feedback; model review complements them.
   Separate new failures from pre-existing or environmental failures.
13. For behaviour-critical work, use approved fixtures or explicit manual
    acceptance steps. Do not treat agent-authored tests alone as sufficient
    evidence when trusted examples are available.
14. For non-trivial changes, obtain an independent read-only review, address
   material findings, and rerun affected checks.
15. When a pattern has failed at least twice, propose the smallest durable
    control in `docs/harness-evolution.md`; never record sensitive data or raw
    transcripts. Stop only when acceptance criteria are met or a concrete
    blocker remains.

## Skill transitions

Keep the same task and plan when another skill becomes appropriate. If a
separate, pre-existing defect needs diagnosis, pass the symptom, reproduction,
confirmed evidence, authorization, and unfinished feature work to
`$agentic-debugging`; use its result when resuming this workflow. If material
choices need an interview, pass the open decisions and known constraints to
`$grill-me`, then resume with its confirmed decisions. For a later standalone
cleanup, pass observable invariants and the requested file scope to
`$refactor-code`. Do not treat a transition as permission to expand scope or
repeat settled discovery.

Do not commit unless the user requests it. Never push, deploy, merge, publish,
modify external systems, or perform destructive actions unless the user
explicitly authorizes the exact action.

Return one handoff containing the outcome, risk tier, decisions and assumptions,
files changed, deterministic and behavioural evidence, review findings, checks
not run with reasons, unresolved risks or blockers, and required user action.
